# Open Knowledge — agent guidance

Open Knowledge (OK) is a markdown-CRDT collaboration platform exposed via MCP. This skill carries the behavioral rules agents need to use it fluently. Every section is a MUST unless marked otherwise.

> **Authoritative source.** Where the MCP server's `instructions` echo overlaps with this skill, this skill wins — the full attach rule, grounding rule, media rules, dead-link verification, and failure-mode guidance live only here.

> Skill version: tracks `@inkeep/open-knowledge-server` package version. Check `cat ~/.ok/skill-state.yml` to see what's installed locally. **Version floor:** `ok seed` (referenced below) requires `@inkeep/open-knowledge` >= 0.4.0. If `ok seed` errors with `unknown command`, upgrade: `npm install -g @inkeep/open-knowledge`.

## TL;DR — the 90% case

1. **Reads:** `exec("cat …")` for a single doc, `exec("ls -A …")` for a directory (with folder defaults + template menu), `exec("grep …")` for literal, `search` for ranked retrieval. Native `Read` / `Grep` only on source code (`.ts` / `.py` / …), never on in-scope `.md` / `.mdx`.
2. **Writes:** `write_document` for new or full-replace, `edit_document` for body-only find/replace, `edit_frontmatter` for 1-2 frontmatter keys (JSON Merge Patch — preferred). Full frontmatter rewrites use `write_document({ position: "replace" })`. `edit_document` rejects frontmatter (HTTP 400).
3. **Preview:** every OK read/write response carries a route-only `previewUrl` (`/#/<doc>`, no host:port). If you have a `preview_*` tool, call `preview_start("open-knowledge-ui")`; otherwise call `get_preview_url` once for the full browser URL and open it in your own in-app browser. Surface to the user on a `start-ui` warning (no UI running). Don't `preview_screenshot` to confirm edits — the CRDT tool response is the confirmation.
4. **Workflow tools** (`ingest` / `research` / `consolidate` / `discover`) return procedural guides, not data. Use them when the work fits the layer; follow their numbered steps.

Everything below is depth. Read on demand.

## Tool index — 22 tools

The full MCP surface, grouped by risk-level. Every tool's `kind` / `action` set is single-risk-level (never a read and a write behind one discriminator).

- **Reads** — `exec` (primary; shell-style `cat`/`ls`/`grep`/`find` with frontmatter + backlink + history enrichment), `search` (ranked, BM25 + recency), `get_history` (versions for a doc), `links` (`kind: 'backlinks'|'forward'|'dead'|'orphans'|'hubs'|'suggest'`), `get_config` (resolved config), `get_components` (canonical component JSX schemas), `get_authoring_palette` (markdown-native authoring forms + themed `html preview` embed starters + theme tokens), `get_preview_url` (browser-reachable preview URL on demand).
- **Writes** — `write_document` (new or full-replace; supports `template:` instantiation), `edit_document` (body-only find/replace), `edit_frontmatter` (1-2 keys via RFC 7396 JSON Merge Patch — preferred), `delete_document`, `rename` (probes file vs folder; rewrites referrers), `version` (`action: 'save'|'rollback'`), `folder_config` (`action: 'set-rule'|'write-template'|'delete-template'`).
- **GitHub-sync conflicts** — `list_conflicts` (enumerate), `get_conflict_content` (base/ours/theirs stages + lifecycle), `resolve_conflict` (write a chosen resolution + commit; destructive). Mutating writes against a doc in conflict return RFC 9457 `urn:ok:error:doc-in-conflict` (409); `exec("cat …")` returns `lifecycle: {status, reason} | null` so you can detect the state proactively. See *Conflict-aware writes*.
- **Workflow** — `ingest`, `research`, `consolidate`, `discover` (return procedural guides, not data).

Tools NOT in OK MCP (they belong to your agent host): `preview_start`, `preview_screenshot`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` / `Edit`. The STOP rule below governs which of those you may use on in-scope markdown.

## STOP — native tools on in-scope `.md` / `.mdx`

When this workspace has Open Knowledge MCP configured, do **not** use your host's native file tools on markdown paths inside the content directory. The ban covers every common rationalization:

- **Native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` on in-scope `.md` / `.mdx`** — the original case.
- **`Bash ls` / `Bash find` / `Bash cat` on dirs containing in-scope markdown** — use `exec("ls -A …")` / `exec("find … -name '*.md'")` / `exec("cat …")` instead. Native returns bare names; `exec` returns frontmatter, backlink counts, and recent activity per child. `-A` shows hidden entries (`.ok/`, `.okignore`) which OK projects carry; omit `.` and `..` rows that `-a` would add.
- **Glob patterns that target markdown** (`**/*.md`, any dir known to be markdown-heavy like `specs/**`, `reports/**`, `docs/**`) — use `exec` with `find`, or `exec("ls -A <dir>")`.
- **Dispatching the Explore / general-purpose subagent for markdown-heavy exploration** — subagents use native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` internally and bypass Open Knowledge entirely. Do markdown exploration yourself via `exec` / `search`. Subagents remain appropriate for **source-code** exploration.
- **Native `Read` / `Grep` on any in-scope markdown inside `.ok/`** — the `.ok/` directory is in-scope; if it carries `.md` / `.mdx`, treat those the same as any other knowledge-base file.

Why: native tools skip frontmatter, backlinks, shadow-repo activity, and project git history that OK's tools return for every matched knowledge-base file. `exec` is the primary read surface; it runs read-only bash (`cat`, `ls`, `grep`, `find`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `cut` — pipes OK) and returns raw stdout plus enriched metadata per file.

**MCP tool visibility — not seeing `exec` is NOT the escape hatch.** MCP wiring varies by client. Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, VS Code — each surfaces MCP differently. Server labels are user-defined; tools may not appear as top-level symbols named `exec` in your specific UI. If Open Knowledge is registered as an MCP server in this workspace, route markdown reads through its `exec` / `search` via your client's documented MCP invocation (including any generic "call MCP tool" flow). Registration is the test, not top-level-symbol visibility.

**Escape hatch.** Native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` on `.md` / `.mdx` is allowed **only** when no Open Knowledge MCP server is registered for this project, **or** immediately after you tried an MCP call and it failed — then begin a user-visible sentence with `Open Knowledge MCP unavailable:`. Never use the hatch because you skipped your client's MCP path, didn't see `exec` as a top-level tool, or rationalized the skill wasn't necessary.

**Source code and non-markdown files** (`.ts`, `.py`, `package.json`, …): native `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` always.

## Reads — examples

- Read a file: `exec("cat <path>.md")` — contents + full rich enrichment.
- List a directory: `exec("ls -A <dir>")` — per-child frontmatter, recursive markdown counts, most-recently-updated doc per subdir, folder-level `frontmatter_defaults` + `templates_available`. Prefer `-A` over plain `ls` to surface dot-prefixed entries (`.ok/`, `.okignore`) without the noisy `.`/`..` rows that `-a` adds.
- Literal search: `exec("grep -rn <term> <dir> | head -5")` — matches + enrichment on matched files.
- Ranked search: `search({ query })` — cmd-K parity (title boost + body BM25 + recency); use when picking the best doc, not when listing every occurrence.

## Preview — open the browser at session start

The user watches your edits land in a live browser preview. Open it once at session start, then keep working. Re-navigate only when the user asks to open a different doc, or to land them on a finished deliverable (see below) — not to re-check your own edits.

**End a turn on the deliverable, not your scratch space.** Keep the preview steady *during* a multi-doc task — don't yank it around to re-check your own edits. But when a turn created or substantially changed user-facing docs, navigate the preview to the primary deliverable before you hand back: the hub / overview / index page when you created several docs, or the changed doc when you changed one. Don't step the user through every supporting source card — the user is watching, so leave them on the result.

**`previewUrl` is a route, not a URL to open.** Every read response (per-doc, on `exec` / `search` / `links` rows) and every write response carries a `previewUrl` — a route fragment like `/#/specs/foo/SPEC`, with **no scheme, host, or port**. It identifies *which doc* to preview, not a URL to hand a browser by itself. Never construct or guess preview URLs.

**Pick how to open the preview by tool capability — not by host name.** Look at the tools actually available to you this session:

- **You have a `preview_*` tool** (e.g. `preview_start`) → call `preview_start("open-knowledge-ui")` and nothing else. The pane supplies its own origin; you never need a URL. Do NOT also call `get_preview_url`. Do NOT read, diagnose, or edit `.claude/launch.json` — that file is host-managed, and the OK lock-collision proxy handles the UI-already-running case automatically. If `preview_start` fails, report it to the user; do not try to "fix" `launch.json`.
- **No `preview_*` tool, but you have an in-app / built-in browser tool** → call `get_preview_url` once to get the full browser URL (`{ url, baseUrl, running }`), then navigate your **in-app browser** to `url`. Pass a `docName` to `get_preview_url` to jump straight to a doc, or omit it for the UI root.
- **No browser tool at all** (a stdio host such as the Codex CLI, which has no embedded browser) → call `get_preview_url`, then `open <url>` in the system browser as a last resort, and say so plainly to the user ("opening the preview in your system browser — this host has no in-app browser"). The system browser is the fallback, never the default.

**Opening or reading a file IS a preview navigation.** On any "open `<file>`" / "read `<file>`" request, navigate the browser to that doc's `previewUrl` route from the tool response — not a separate fetch, not a fresh system-browser launch.

**Four signals to check if the preview is already attached** (read these from each write response):

1. You opened/navigated earlier this session → don't reopen.
2. Write response has `previewUrl` (non-null route) and NO `warning` → a browser is attached somewhere; do nothing.
3. `warning: { action: "attach-preview-once", previewUrl, message }` → UI reachable, no browser attached; navigate one-shot (`preview_start`, or `get_preview_url` → in-app browser).
4. `warning: { action: "start-ui", previewUrl: null, message }` → no UI running anywhere. Surface the message verbatim — recovery options are in the in-band copy. Don't loop on retries.

Warnings fire at most once per session in the fresh-start case.

**`previewUrl: null` only means "no UI reachable" on the three attach-warning tools: `write_document` / `edit_document` / `edit_frontmatter`.** Workflow tools return prose and don't carry `previewUrl`. `delete_document` / `rename` emit `previousPreviewUrl` (different field, for closing stale tabs) and don't fire attach warnings. `get_preview_url` reports `running: false` + `url: null` when no UI is running.

If you see `"Hocuspocus server is not running"`, run `ok start` and retry.

OK Electron and `ok ui` share `ui.lock`; when a second UI binds a different port, the OK lock-collision proxy bridges it to the live server transparently. That is exactly why `previewUrl` is route-only — the port behind the proxy is not the agent's to use. **Do not nudge the user to quit OK Electron to free a port** — the proxy handles it, and quitting tears down a UI in active use.

**The preview is read-only for the agent — it is the user's view, not a surface you read back.** You cannot click or type to drive edits — the CRDT flow is one-way (agent → MCP → CRDT → preview).

**No screenshots to confirm edits, no generic verification loop.** Do NOT take `preview_screenshot` (host tool, not OK MCP) after a write, and do not run a generic snapshot/eval/screenshot verification loop — OK's preview is a read-only, one-way mirror, so the CRDT tool response *is* the confirmation that an edit landed. Screenshot only when debugging a visual rendering issue or when the user explicitly asks to see the preview — never to confirm an edit landed.

## Writing

Call `write_document` / `edit_document` as soon as you have content. Native `Edit` / `sed` / direct `Write` on in-scope markdown is forbidden — it bypasses the CRDT and loses agent attribution in the shadow repo.

To delete a doc, call `delete_document` — never `rm` / `unlink` / native `Bash` removal on in-scope markdown. The MCP path closes open agent sessions and unloads the doc from Hocuspocus before unlinking; native `rm` desynchronizes those. Deletion is irreversible — call `version({ action: "save" })` first if you may need to roll back (restore via `version({ action: "rollback" })`; list snapshots via `get_history`), and `links({ kind: "backlinks", docName })` first if you want to fix referrers that will become redlinks. To move or rename a doc instead of delete + rewrite, use `rename({ from, to })` — it auto-detects file vs folder and rewrites incoming references atomically.

**If `edit_document` returns "Text not found" on text you can verify exists on disk** (via `exec("cat …")`), the MCP session is likely stale (e.g., after a folder rename or server restart). Treat this as the escape-hatch trigger from the STOP block: prefix your next user-visible sentence with `Open Knowledge MCP unavailable:` and report the inconsistency. Don't loop on retries — the symptom is structural, not transient.

## Conflict-aware writes

Projects with GitHub sync enabled may carry docs in a merge-conflict state. The MCP server refuses every mutating call against such a doc with a structured RFC 9457 response:

```json
{
  "type": "urn:ok:error:doc-in-conflict",
  "title": "Document is in conflict.",
  "status": 409,
  "detail": "The document is in a merge-conflict state. Call get_conflict_content + resolve_conflict before retrying.",
  "file": "notes/sso.md",
  "resolutionOptions": ["mine", "theirs", "content"]
}
```

The gate covers `write_document`, `edit_document`, `delete_document`, `rename`, `version` (`action: 'rollback'`), `folder_config` (`action: 'write-template'|'delete-template'`), and agent undo. You cannot route around it by writing content that byte-matches one of the merge stages — the gate refuses on lifecycle state, not on body equality.

**Detect proactively.** `exec("cat <path>.md")` always returns `lifecycle: {status, reason} | null` alongside the body. When `status === 'conflict'`, switch to the resolution flow before attempting any mutation.

**Resolution flow.** Three tools compose:

1. `list_conflicts()` → enumerate every doc currently tracked in conflict.
2. `get_conflict_content({ file })` → fetch `base` / `ours` / `theirs` stages plus the doc's `lifecycleStatus`. `ours` reflects the live Y.Text (what the human user sees in the editor) when the doc is loaded server-side and is marker-free; falls back to `git show :2:<file>` otherwise (e.g. after an editor reopen seeded markers into Y.Text).
3. `resolve_conflict({ file, strategy, content? })` → write the chosen bytes and commit. Strategies: `mine` writes `git show :2:`, `theirs` writes `git show :3:`, `content` writes the bytes you supply.

`file` is a `.md` / `.mdx` path relative to the project dir (extension included) — mirrors the on-disk shape, not the extension-less `docName` used by other tools.

The resolve operation is best-effort and NOT atomic: `git checkout --ours/--theirs && git add` may succeed but the subsequent `git commit --no-edit` can fail (pre-commit hook rejection, locked index). On commit failure the staged files are re-`git add`-ed back into the unmerged index and the tracked entry remains in `conflicts.json` — re-call `resolve_conflict` after the user clears the blocker.

## Components — write the markdown-native form, not JSX

OK auto-promotes markdown-native syntax into themed canonical components at parse time. **Write the markdown-native form — don't reach for JSX when one exists.** The promoted component is themed, accessible, and part of the content graph; hand-rolled JSX is none of those, and it fights the model's markdown prior instead of using it.

| Want | Write this (markdown-native) | Promotes to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Callout / admonition | `> [!NOTE]` + body — 15 types (NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, WARNING, CAUTION, …); append `+` / `-` (`> [!NOTE]+`) to make it foldable | themed Callout |
| Collapsible section | `<details><summary>Title</summary>` … `</details>` | themed Accordion |
| Diagram | a ` ```mermaid ` fenced block (flowchart, sequence, class, state, ER, gantt, pie) | Mermaid diagram |
| Math | `$x$` inline, `$$…$$` block | KaTeX Math |
| Inline a doc or asset | `![[file]]` | wiki embed |

`Tabs` is the lone canonical with **no** markdown-native form — write the JSX directly (`<Tabs><Tab label="…">…</Tab></Tabs>`). For any canonical's full JSX prop schema, call `get_components({ ids })`. If no canonical fits, any `<TagName>…</TagName>` falls through as raw MDX — but prefer a canonical when one matches.

**Discover the palette in one call.** `get_authoring_palette` returns every markdown-native form (copy-ready `example` + `guidance`), the themed `html preview` embed starters, and the injected theme-token list — the source of truth for component-forward, themed authoring. Canonical names/counts beyond the markdown-native set are project-specific; the inventory in the `write_document` / `edit_document` descriptions and `get_components` are authoritative for those.

**Show findings, don't just tell them.** When a point is quantitative or comparative — a trend over time, a breakdown, a before/after, a ranking, a distribution — present it visually: a chart or stat-card `html preview` embed, a ` ```mermaid ` diagram, a table, or a Callout for the headline takeaway. Prose-only buries the insight. This matters most where the document's job is to make findings legible — **`research` reports and `consolidate` articles especially**, and any write-up meant to present results. A research article with three dense paragraphs of numbers should have been a chart. Reach for `get_authoring_palette` as you draft, not after.

### `html preview` — themed interactive embeds

A ` ```html preview ` fence (also `htm` / `xml`) renders a standalone HTML/CSS/JS page as a live sandboxed iframe — the extend-to-anything primitive for charts, stat cards, custom SVG, calculators, demos. The iframe auto-sizes to its content; pass `h=` / `w=` (e.g. ` ```html preview h=400px `) only to pin a fixed size.

**Start from a starter — don't hand-roll.** `get_authoring_palette` returns `embedPatterns` (chart, stat cards, custom SVG, interactive control), each already wired to the theme tokens. Copy one and fill in your data — that is the only path that cannot render unthemed. Hand-author a fence from scratch only when no starter is close.

**MUST — never hardcode colors in an `html preview` embed.** OK injects its theme tokens into every preview iframe; an embed that hardcodes hex / `rgb()` renders unthemed — a white box on a dark page, clashing with every component around it. This is the single most common embed mistake. Wire every color to a token: `var(--chart-1..5)` for chart series, `var(--foreground)` / `var(--muted-foreground)` for text, `var(--card)` / `var(--background)` for surfaces, plus `var(--border)`, `var(--primary)`, `var(--radius)`. Don't set a `body` background at all unless you specifically mean to — the iframe already carries a themed one.

````
```html preview
<div style="font-family:system-ui;padding:20px;color:var(--foreground)">
  <h3 style="margin:0 0 10px">Themed embed</h3>
  <div style="display:flex;gap:8px">
    <div style="flex:1;height:48px;background:var(--chart-1);border-radius:var(--radius)"></div>
    <div style="flex:1;height:48px;background:var(--chart-2);border-radius:var(--radius)"></div>
    <div style="flex:1;height:48px;background:var(--chart-3);border-radius:var(--radius)"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```
````

Done wrong, that same embed is `body{background:#fff;color:#1a1a1a}` with a `background:#2563eb` bar — a white box with a hardcoded blue, blind to the reader's theme.

**Charts.** A pure-CSS or inline-SVG chart wired to `var(--chart-*)` re-skins on a theme toggle for free — prefer it. A JS charting library (Chart.js, D3) works too, but a themed `body` does NOT theme the colors you pass the library in JS — read the token at runtime instead of hardcoding:

```js
const c1 = getComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--chart-1').trim();
// → pass c1 to Chart.js / D3 as the series color
```

**Boundary.** Reach for a canonical (via its markdown-native form) when one matches the semantic need — it is themed and integrated. Reach for ` ```html preview ` for interactive or bespoke content no canonical covers. ` ```<lang> ` fences for other languages are plain syntax-highlighted code, no preview.

## Grounding — every factual claim needs a source (MUST)

Knowledge-base docs are factual artifacts — whether the project is a wiki, an LLM brain, a spec collection, a research log, or anything else markdown-shaped. Every claim must be traceable, and **the source has to live inside the knowledge base**, not float on the public web.

- **The knowledge base is source-of-truth — closed loop.** External sources don't get *cited out* to the live web; they get *pulled in* via `ingest`, then cited locally. A bare `[source](https://...)` URL inside a knowledge-base doc is **not** a finished citation — it's a TODO that says "this source still needs to be ingested." The chain only works if every leaf is a local doc.
- **Every factual claim MUST cite its source at the point of claim.** No unsourced speculation.
- **Web sources for knowledge-base docs** → fetch the page (your host's `WebFetch` / `WebSearch` / equivalent), then `ingest` it as a local doc, then cite the local path: `[source name](./path/to/source.md)`. The local doc carries the original URL in its frontmatter `source_url:`. **Inline `[source](URL)` is a chat affordance, not a knowledge-base one.**
- **Self-fetched counts.** When YOU fetched a URL to ground a claim that's about to land in the knowledge base, that fetch triggers `ingest` exactly like a user share does. Don't downgrade to inline-URL citation because the fetch was agent-initiated — same KB, same closed-loop contract.
- **Internal cross-refs** → standard markdown link to the OK doc that contains the authoritative claim: `[text](./path/to/doc.md)`. The linked doc itself must cite its sources — chains should terminate in preserved local docs. Where ingested sources live is project-specific (an `external-sources/` folder if the project uses Karpathy's layout; wherever the project's existing layout puts raw references otherwise).
- **If you don't have evidence:**
  1. Run a web search and `ingest` the result, OR
  2. Mark inline `(TODO: needs source)` so a human can verify, OR
  3. Don't write the claim. Do NOT fabricate.
- Unsourced speculation looks authoritative but rots into tribal knowledge that can't be audited. The knowledge base loses its value if readers can't trust it.
- If a fact is in the knowledge base, a reader must be able to trace it to its origin via local docs only — no dead-link-on-the-public-web exposure.

## Linking — use standard markdown links

- **Every noun-phrase that names another document should be linked** using standard markdown link syntax: `[text](./relative/path.md)` or `[text](/absolute/from/content-root.md)`.
- **External web sources are NOT inline body links.** Per the Grounding rule above, web URLs live in the `source_url:` frontmatter of an ingested doc under `external-sources/` (or the project's equivalent raw-sources folder); the body cites the local path: `[source name](./external-sources/source-slug.md)`. A raw `[source](https://...)` inline in the body is a TODO, not a citation — see Grounding for the closed-loop contract.
- **Internal cross-refs between OK docs** → `[text](./other-doc.md)` — link liberally to aid navigation.
- **Every link must resolve to a doc that exists.** Never link to a doc that isn't written yet. If you want to reference something that should have its own page but doesn't: create that page in the same pass, or record it as a tracked task (`TaskCreate`, or your host's task tool — if the host has none, tell the user) and leave the mention as plain prose. A broken link is debt, not a to-do marker.
- **Never wrap a link in backticks.** `` `[text](./foo.md)` `` is a bug — the backticks make it render as literal code rather than a link.
- **Never use HTML anchors** (`<a href="...">`). Markdown link syntax only.
- **Verify before walking away.** After writing a doc, call `links({ kind: "dead", sourceDocNames: ["your/doc"] })` to find broken references. Fix or remove every one — a dead link is never acceptable to leave behind. Companion `links` kinds: `backlinks` (incoming), `forward` (outgoing), `orphans` (no incoming), `hubs` (high-incoming), `suggest` (untextualized mentions worth linking).
- **The editor's red-underline visual lies.** Its dead-link detection tolerates slug-fallback (e.g., `foo` may appear resolved because `foo.md` exists at root). `links({ kind: "dead" })` is strict-exact — trust the tool, not the visual.

**Note on wiki-link syntax (`[[Page]]`):** the parser still handles it for legacy content, but it's NO LONGER the recommended default. Write new content with standard markdown links per above. Seed-pack templates (`ok seed --pack <name>`) may still emit `[[Page]]` placeholders inside template body text — those are legacy. When you instantiate a seed-pack template, replace the legacy placeholders with standard markdown links during the `{shape}`-fill pass.

## Media — images and attachments

- **Markdown syntax only:** `![alt text](./path/to/image.png)`. Do NOT emit HTML `<img>` tags — they don't participate in OK's content graph and don't render consistently across Fumadocs / preview surfaces. Paths resolve relative to the doc.
- **Save locally, don't hot-link.** Hot-linked external image URLs rot when the source disappears. Fetch (`WebFetch` / `curl`), save to a local path, reference via relative markdown link, cite the source below.
- **Placement model.** Free-form image embeds → co-located alongside the referencing doc (sha256 same-directory dedup). Raw sources via `ingest` → `external-sources/<slug>.<ext>` + `external-sources/<slug>.md` (the wrapper-binary pair). Check via `exec("ls -A")` if the project uses a different convention.
- **Cannot fetch** (no network, paywall) → don't invent a local path. Omit, or mark inline `(TODO: image needs sourcing from <URL>)`.
- **Meaningful alt text required** — describes WHAT the image shows, not what it is. `![]()` / `![image]()` / `![filename.png]()` all fail. OK indexes alt text — it's both accessibility AND searchability.
- **Cite web image sources** below the image (Grounding rule):
  ```markdown
  ![Aang using the Avatar State to defeat Ozai](./assets/images/aang/avatar-state.png)
  *Source: [Avatar Wiki — Aang](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Aang#Avatar_State)*
  ```
  Original diagrams/screenshots may caption `*Original*` or omit. Unattributed web images are equivalent to unsourced factual claims.

## Folders, frontmatter, templates

Every `.md` / `.mdx` file needs YAML frontmatter — `title` + `description` required, `tags` recommended:

```yaml
---
title: Article Title
description: Brief summary
tags: [relevant, tags]
---
```

Folder defaults live in opt-in nested `<folder>/.ok/frontmatter.yml`; templates live in `<folder>/.ok/templates/`. **Most folders have NO `.ok/`** — sparse, lazy-create, auto-clean. A folder gets one only when it declares defaults or carries templates.

```
content-root/
├── .ok/                        ← project root .ok/ (config.yml, cache)
├── meetings/
│   ├── .ok/
│   │   ├── frontmatter.yml     ← folder defaults
│   │   └── templates/
│   │       └── prep-notes.md
│   └── 2026-05-01.md
└── research/                   ← no .ok/ — inherits root cascade
    └── auth-providers.md
```

**Cascade merge:** scalars (`title`, `description`) replace last-wins root → leaf; arrays (`tags`) union-and-dedup; file frontmatter wins per-scalar over folder defaults, tags union with the cascade.

### Read the folder before writing (MUST)

Before creating or editing docs in a folder, **always** call `exec("ls -A <folder>")` once. The response carries `frontmatter_defaults` (the merged cascade) + `templates_available` (the template menu for `write_document({ template })`). Skipping this is how agents land docs that violate folder discipline.

Pre-write checklist:

0. **First-contact check.** If `frontmatter_defaults` AND `templates_available` are empty AND `exec("ls -A")` shows substantial content elsewhere, the project hasn't been onboarded — STOP and invoke `discover` (Workflow tools below). Skip on subsequent writes once confirmed.
1. **Read `frontmatter_defaults`** — don't redeclare keys the cascade already provides; let inheritance carry them.
2. **Read `templates_available`** — each entry has `name`, `title`, `description`, `scope` (`local` / `inherited`). If one matches, **prefer it** over free-form markdown (it's the folder's contract — templates carry frontmatter + body structure hand-authored docs routinely miss).
3. **Read recent siblings** — new docs should match the shape of existing ones (filename, frontmatter, body structure).
4. **Confirm content scope** — `content.dir` (`.ok/config.yml`) defines the root. `.gitignore` / `.okignore` (nested at any depth) define exclusions.

**Once per folder per session** — the checklist doesn't repeat unless you (or the user) changed a folder rule or template since.

### When to use a template (MUST when one fits)

Instantiate via `write_document({ template, docName, position: "replace" })`. Inherited templates (`scope: "inherited"`) are equally valid. Skip only when (a) `templates_available` is empty, (b) no entry matches, OR (c) the user asked for free-form. If you skip, briefly note why in chat.

### When to create a template

Templates make folder structure durable. Create them proactively:

- 2+ sibling docs share a skeleton in a folder with no template → extract via `folder_config({ action: "write-template" })`.
- About to write a doc in a folder where no template fits, AND the shape is reusable → save as template the same turn.
- Scaffolding a new folder for a doc category → pair the rule (`folder_config({ action: "set-rule" })`) with a template in the same turn.
- The user describes a recurring doc shape ("we always log meetings with attendees, agenda, action items") → author the template once.

Note new templates in chat ("saved as a template at `meetings/.ok/templates/prep-notes.md` for next time") so the user sees the discipline grew.

### When to declare folder defaults (MUST when a pattern emerges)

If you're writing the same frontmatter (tags, title prefix) on multiple siblings, call `folder_config({ action: "set-rule" })` once and let the cascade do it. Pair with a template when the body skeleton also repeats.

### Editing folder defaults

```ts
folder_config({
  action: "set-rule",
  rules: [
    { match: "meetings/**", frontmatter: { title: "Meetings", tags: ["meeting"] } },
    { match: "meetings/prep-notes/**", frontmatter: { tags: ["meeting", "prep"] } },
  ],
})
```

Each `match` resolves to a SINGLE target folder. Multi-folder globs (`specs/*/evidence/**`) are rejected with `MULTI_FOLDER_GLOB` — split per folder. Remove a rule by passing empty `frontmatter: {}` — file deletes and `.ok/` auto-cleans if no other tenant remains.

### Creating templates

```ts
folder_config({
  action: "write-template",
  folder: "meetings/",
  name: "prep-notes",
  body: "# {Meeting Title}\n\n**Attendees:** \n**Date:** \n\n## Agenda\n- \n",
  frontmatter: {
    title: "Meeting Prep Notes",          // REQUIRED — TEMPLATE_TITLE_REQUIRED if missing
    description: "Use before a meeting.", // recommended — soft warning if absent
    tags: ["meeting", "prep"],
  },
})
```

**Substitution allowlist:** template bodies MAY use exactly two server-side substitutions — `{{date}}` (today's ISO-8601 date) and `{{user}}` (calling principal display name). Other `{{...}}` tokens are rejected at write time with `TEMPLATE_UNKNOWN_VARIABLE`. Plain `{shape}` placeholders (e.g., `{Meeting Title}`) are LITERAL — agents fill via subsequent `edit_document` calls. Delete a template via `folder_config({ action: "delete-template", folder, name })` (auto-cleans empty `.ok/templates/` and `.ok/`).

### Creating a doc from a template

```ts
// Inspect the menu (already done in the pre-write checklist).
exec("ls -A meetings/")
// → templates_available: [{ name: "prep-notes", title: "Meeting Prep Notes", scope: "local" }, ...]

// Instantiate. `template` and `markdown` are mutually exclusive.
write_document({
  docName: "meetings/2026-05-02-roadmap-sync",
  template: "prep-notes",
  position: "replace",
})

// Fill the `{shape}` placeholders via follow-up edit_document calls.
```

Templates resolve via leaf → root walk-up at the target's parent folder, closest-wins on filename collision. **`template` and `markdown` are mutually exclusive** — passing both errors with `TEMPLATE_AND_MARKDOWN_BOTH_SET`. Substitution happens at instantiation time only; templates on disk show the raw `{{date}}` token.

### Editing frontmatter

`edit_document` does NOT change frontmatter (body-only; frontmatter-intersecting find/replace returns HTTP 400). For single-key edits, prefer `edit_frontmatter({ docName, patch: { key: value } })` — JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396), `null` deletes, field-level CRDT merge, atomic per-call. For full rewrites (≥3-5 keys, or body + frontmatter together), call `write_document({ position: "replace", markdown })` and include the new YAML block.

### Binary-source wrappers (`ingest`-produced)

Docs that wrap a co-located binary file under `external-sources/` carry extra frontmatter so the wrapper-binary pair is fully described:

```yaml
---
title: ...
description: ...
source_url: https://example.com/file.pdf
source_path: ./<slug>.<ext>      # relative to this wrapper
media_type: application/pdf
bytes: 1234567
sha256: <64-char hex>            # of the embedded binary
date_fetched: YYYY-MM-DD
preservation: binary             # OR: text-only / text-extracted
supersedes:                      # OPTIONAL — dated-sibling re-ingest
  - <prior-slug>.md
tags: [source, immutable, layer-ingest, binary]
---

![[<slug>.<ext>]]
```

Body is just the wiki-embed. PDFs/opaque attachments render as a click-dispatching File row; `<Pdf src="./<slug>.pdf" />` is the opt-in inline viewer. See `ingest`'s tool body for full re-ingest / size / executable rules.

## Cadence

When you make a multi-step change (batch of new docs, folder restructure), pause between steps to let the browser preview catch up. The CRDT edit streams live; the preview follows your edit cadence. Don't batch 10 writes in a row — interleave the writes so the user watching the browser sees the narrative progress.

This is primarily a human-watchability concern — the user watches edits land in the preview; interleaved cadence makes the narrative legible. When the batch is done, navigate the preview to the primary deliverable (see "End a turn on the deliverable" in §Preview).

**Hub docs.** Don't *create* `INDEX.md` / `README.md` hub files solely to catalog children — `exec("ls -A <folder>")` returns the same view live, with per-file frontmatter + backlink counts. But if a hub doc *already exists* from prior work, keep it updated as children change — interleave: write child → update hub → write next child, rather than batching five child edits and a single trailing hub update.

## Log discipline — check for a project log when KB content changes

Some projects keep an append-only project log to make agent activity auditable. **After any turn that creates, edits, or restructures docs in the knowledge base, check for a project log:** look for a `log.md` at the project root (or at the seed `rootDir` if `ok seed --root <dir>` was used). If one exists, follow whatever its frontmatter `description:` and in-file comment say — they carry the project-specific contract (entry shape, cadence, categories). Different projects log differently — some treat the log as a wiki audit trail, others as an LLM-brain history, others as a spec changelog. If no `log.md` exists, no log discipline applies; don't fabricate one.

The skill carries the trigger ("KB content changed this turn — go look"). The file owns the policy.

## Workflow tools — when to invoke them

Four MCP tools build on the primitives above. **They return *procedural guidance* (a multi-step instructional body), not fetched data.** Calling `ingest("https://…")` does not download and write a doc for you — it returns a multi-step plan you then execute. Same for `research` / `consolidate` / `discover`. Plan to follow the numbered steps in order; don't skip the STOP gates.

Three correspond to [Karpathy's three-layer knowledge-base pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) (`ingest` / `research` / `consolidate`); the fourth (`discover`) operates at the project-metadata layer and is the brownfield counterpart to the greenfield `ok seed` CLI:

| Tool          | Layer                   | When to invoke                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ingest`      | Raw sources (immutable) | User shares a URL/PDF/file to preserve verbatim, **OR you fetched a URL** (`WebFetch` / `WebSearch` / equivalent) to ground a claim that's about to land in the knowledge base. The KB is closed-loop — agent-initiated fetches are not exempt. **Binary sources** (PDFs, images, audio, Office docs) are preserved verbatim, not text-scraped — the tool body documents the binary-vs-text classification, write-path STOP gates (executable, size, scheme), re-ingest semantics, and shell-less fallback. No analysis in the file itself — takeaways go back to the user in chat. |
| `research`    | KB, provisional         | User asks you to investigate, compare alternatives, or synthesize multiple sources. Produces a `status: provisional` article with a `sources:` list. Follows scan-first routing, a STOP scoping gate, 3P-external framing, and a validate checklist — the tool body enforces each step. |
| `consolidate` | KB, canonical           | Team has actually decided after research and wants the outcome committed as source-of-truth. Starts with a STOP gate confirming the decision exists; writes a `status: canonical` article with a `supersedes:` chain.                                                                   |
| `discover`    | Project metadata        | First arrival at a repo with existing content AND no folder frontmatter / templates set. Extracts conventions from siblings; activates the link graph (orphans, hubs, untextualized mentions); proposes folder frontmatter + templates + `.okignore`; per-phase user confirmation. Phases 1-4 run fs-direct; Phase 5 (link-graph activation) needs `ok start` (Phase 5 step 0 gates). Skip on empty repos (use `ok seed`). One-shot; idempotent on re-run. |

**These tools are your default move, not `write_document`.** When the work fits one of the three layers — preserving an external source, investigating/synthesizing, committing a decided outcome — invoke the corresponding tool instead of going straight to `write_document` / `edit_document`. The tool bodies enforce framing (sources, status, supersedes chains) that hand-written articles routinely miss. `write_document` is correct for everything that does **not** fit the three layers (specs, runbooks, scratch notes, project pages); for the three that do, lead with the tool. This is doubly true in projects that ran `ok seed` — a doc landing in `external-sources/` / `research/` / `articles/` should have come out of `ingest` / `research` / `consolidate`.

Typical day-2 flow: user shares a URL → `ingest` (preserve) → user asks "now research this" → `research` (provisional article + `ingest`s more sources as needed) → decision lands → `consolidate` (canonical article, supersedes the research).

**Autonomy gates vs session-level autonomy.** Per-tool STOP gates (e.g. `research`'s scoping gate, `consolidate`'s decision-confirmation gate) are not overridden by session-level "work without stopping for clarifying questions" hints. The session-level hint covers trivial back-and-forth ("which file did you mean?"); per-tool gates exist for 1-way-door decisions where the tool deliberately wants confirmation before continuing. When in doubt, treat the per-tool gate as authoritative and the session-level autonomy hint as a default for the in-between turns.

**Do not chain silently.** After `ingest`, ask the user whether to proceed to `research`. After `research`, let the user decide whether the findings are ready to `consolidate`. Each tool completes on its own terms — the user drives the transitions.

**Repeat invocations.** Workflow tools return their full instructional body on every call, including 2nd / 3rd / Nth invocation in the same session. If you've already received a tool's body earlier this session, you can skim the repeat for changes (the body can evolve across server versions) but you don't need to re-internalize it — proceed to the next step with the new arguments.

**Project scaffolding — two paths.** **Empty repo:** run `ok seed` once from a terminal (scaffolds Karpathy three-layer + seeds `log.md` + registers folder defaults). **Existing content:** invoke `discover` (MCP tool, table above — extracts conventions from siblings, sets folder frontmatter + templates, curates `.okignore`, activates link graph; per-phase confirmation gates). Neither is required; the four workflow tools work against any folder structure. Only mention each when explicitly relevant.

## Server lifecycle

If `write_document` or `edit_document` returns a "Hocuspocus server is not running" error, start it with `ok start` (via Bash) and retry. Never fall back to native `Edit` / `Write` for in-scope markdown — always route through the MCP write tools so edits go through the CRDT with proper attribution.

## Scope recap

Open Knowledge looks for documents under the resolved `content.dir` (discoverable at runtime via `get_config({ path: ['content', 'dir'] })`). `.gitignore` and `.okignore` (at the project root and at any folder depth) define exclusions. Folder defaults + templates live in nested `<folder>/.ok/frontmatter.yml` + `<folder>/.ok/templates/` files — NOT in `.ok/config.yml`.

Default mental model (no jargon): **every `.md` and `.mdx` under `content.dir`** not excluded by `.gitignore` or `.okignore` is an Open Knowledge document — including under `specs/`, `reports/`, `docs/`, etc. Read `.okignore` (and any nested `.okignore` files) once per turn to know what's excluded.

**First session in this project?** If `frontmatter_defaults` and `templates_available` are empty for substantial folders, the project hasn't been onboarded yet — invoke `discover` (Workflow tools table) before writing. Once onboarded, the cascade carries the discipline.
